## Introduction

 The Interactive Whac-A-Mole Game project is an innovative arcade-style game designed to
 provide an engaging and competitive experience for two players. Utilizing an Arduino Mega
 microcontroller, the game integrates momentary push buttons for player interaction, 16x2 LCD
 screens for real-time score tracking, and an emergency stop button for safety. Players compete
 to reach a score of 20 by hitting mole targets, with the system ensuring accurate score updates
 and smooth gameplay. This project demonstrates the practical application of embedded systems
 in game design, combining various components to create a seamless and interactive experience.
 
 Key objectives of the Interactive Whac-A-Mole Game include developing a responsive
 game that accurately detects button presses, implementing real-time score tracking through
 LCD displays, and ensuring safe operation with an emergency stop button. The game is
 designed to be both fun and educational, showcasing the versatility and potential of embedded
 systems. The project also emphasizes cost-effectiveness, using a 12V 3A DC power adapter
 with a buck converter to ensure a stable power supply, and ensuring compatibility of all
 components with the Arduino Mega microcontroller.
